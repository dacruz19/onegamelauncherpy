# onegamelauncherpy
A one game launcher made with python
one of my first projects, pretty basic, feel free to modify it and use it for your own user, i'm just posting these so that I have something to show lol.

The script if you can't be bothered to read, the script makes a file which saves your game paths, so feel free to make a directory specifically for it.
