# onegamelauncherpy
A one game launcher made with python
one of my first projects, pretty basic, feel free to modify it and use it for your own user, i'm just posting these so that I have something to show lol.
also it works with roblox, and also change the premade directories to your liking add, remove do whatever you want.

You can add in or remove any directories just in here, or customise it if you have any extra drives, these current directories were just mine so obviously won't be the same on all devices.
``base_Dirs = ["C://Program Files/EA Games/", "C://Program Files/Epic Games/","C://Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/","C://Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/games"]``

The script if you can't be bothered to read, the script makes a file which saves your game paths, so feel free to make a directory specifically for it.

## Notes
- Make sure you have the ``customtkinter`` module, for me I just personally prefer it.
- If you don't have it, just do ``pip install customtkinter``, on your terminal and it should install, otherwise idk just look up a tutorial lol.
- If you need any help just add me on discord _.vrye
